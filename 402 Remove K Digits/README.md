This question asks for the use of stacks and greedy algorithm. I didn't use stack and still solved the problem, but the time is not that good, though accepted by the OJ.

I used loops to find the correct digit to be removed from the string and then when k digits has been removed, I output the remaining digits. Sometimes when the string begins with "0", we have to delete the front 0s.
