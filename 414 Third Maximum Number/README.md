This question is kind of interesting. There is a function called the nth_element() in c++ STL. However, this question doesn't fit in this case, since there may be duplicate values.

As this question only asks the third value, so we can declare a vector of size 3 and store the current met largest 3 elements in the vector. Then, after reading the whole array, we can output the third largest element by reading the vector.
