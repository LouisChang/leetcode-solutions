This question is kind of tricky. Since it has a range for input value, which is an integer. One way to test the number is trying to find all of the number's positive divisors and sum them up. This is time consuming. Another way is to first find all the perfect numbers in the range and then check if the input is in the vector. Fortunately, the number of perfect numbers not exceed 100,000,000 is only 5.
